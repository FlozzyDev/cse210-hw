Scripture Memorizer Project 

----------------Extra feature Ideas------------------------
1. Creating a "data" class to hold a list of Scriptures that I randomly choose from at start. (COMPLETE)
2. Make the number of words more dynamic (hide more or less based on number of words not hidden yet) (COMPLETE)
3. Loop in new scriptures until the user enters quit.
4. Using the data class, create additional classes for quotes. Add ability for user to type in data file they want to memorize. 






----------------Notes------------------------
So I'm going to first finish the base program, and then the plan is to loop new scriptures in as you finish (instead of ending). 
If I'm feeling crazy, I wanted to offer a menu at start to choose which data type you wanted to memorize and offer options (famous quotes / equations / formulas / syntax)
I'm thinking it could become a bit like a flashcard program, where you provide a data set and it helps you memorize whatever it is. 
This week is fairly busy at work so we will see how far I can get. 

2/12/24 - I will fully admit that adding the dataclass probably made this way more complicated than what it needed to be, but my hope is it will be worth it if I add some other
data to pull in since it's a bit generic and I have a template if I use CSVs. I'm also pretty confident that I will be making the scripture / quote constructors static as I only
should ever need 1 at a time. Still need to read more to better understand them, but I'm fairly confident that will solve some of my grosser code, like making the null/null Scripture.
